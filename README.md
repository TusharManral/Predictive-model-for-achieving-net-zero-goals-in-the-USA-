# Predictive-model-for-achieving-net-zero-goals-in-the-USA-

This research developed a forecasting algorithm to predict future CO2 emissions across the USA. To determine the key factors impacting carbon emissions, the study examined past data on energy use, technological advancements, and legislative Laws. To improve the model’s accuracy and efficiency, feature engineering and hyperparameter optimisation were combined with machine learning approaches including Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA, and SARIMA.  Among the models, Random Forest was the best model that forecasted CO2 emissions with the highest accuracy as compared to other models with Low Mean Absolute (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Moreover, Random Forest was further tested on the INDIA CO2 emission dataset, demonstrating its flexibility to multiple national settings with varying patterns of energy use, economic structures, and regulatory frameworks. The replication’s success highlighted the model’s adaptability and potential for wider use in nations with different economic and energy uses.

By combining past data with complex predictive techniques, policymakers, business executives, and environmental scientists may all benefit greatly from the research’s important findings. The model provided an effective, data-driven tool for projecting future emissions and aided in the creation of stronger plans and schemes to fulfil the environmental objectives. Furthermore, the study emphasised the model’s importance for global carbon emission mitigation efforts, providing a workable option for countries aiming to meet their Net-zero targets. In the end, by offering useful information and directing better-informed decisions on emissions reduction, our study eventually promoted a sustainable, carbon-free future.
